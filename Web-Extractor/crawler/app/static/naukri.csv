We serve organizations of all sizes, including 86 percent of global Fortune 500 companies. In fact, for over a decade, Veritas has been recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for both Enterprise Backup Software and Integrated Appliances and Enterprise Information Archiving.

Veritas helps enterprises address information management challenges with a complete, organized product strategy and roadmap focused on their needs. Our backup and recovery, business continuity, software-defined storage, and information governance products help keep businesses up and running so they can focus on what they do best. The need for Veritas has never been greater. Unchecked data growth is an expensive burden-and a potential security risk. With a majority of the world's enterprise data holding no legal, regulatory, or business value, the cost in time, money, and resources to store and manage it is staggering. But how do companies separate the valuable from the volume? Veritas solutions help them identify the needles of high-value information buried deep inside every corporate data haystack. Our approach to helping companies defy the data deluge is governed by three beliefs:€¢         Not all data is created equal. €¢         Infrastructure availability does not equal business uptime. €¢         Know what data you have, keep only the data you need.  The majority of target-rich data, housed in general IT systems and metadata, is information that Veritas already touches with our backup, archive, and storage management solutions. We're uniquely positioned to bring these together to provide companies with access to information that drives informed decision-making."
